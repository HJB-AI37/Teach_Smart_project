# TeachSmart

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

TeachSmart is an AI-driven intelligent tutoring and classroom management system designed to empower teachers with advanced tools for personalized education, automated administrative tasks, and data-driven insights. It aims to enhance the educational experience by providing real-time support and resources tailored to the needs of both students and teachers. 


## Background

1- Teacher Burnout and Stress:
Problem: High levels of stress and burnout among teachers due to overwhelming workloads.
Frequency: Over 50% of teachers experience high levels of stress and workload issues (National Center for Education Statistics).

2- Administrative Burden:

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges
